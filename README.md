# WiserSms

Medium Rare Outgoing SMS

## Requirements

_WiserSms_ only support Rails >= 3.x.

## Setup

You can do normal gem installation for `wiser_sms`:

    gem install wiser_sms

or in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'wiser_sms', '~> 0.1.0'
```

Then restart your application.

## Usage

### Request to send SMS

To send SMS for single receiver, pass the string 11-digit string mobile mobile number and message using the `send` method:

```ruby
   WiserSms::Ph.send("091711292013", "You really did it!")
```

To send SMS for multiple receivers, pass the array of 11-digit string mobile number instead:

```ruby
  WiserSms::Ph.send(["091711292013","091711302013"], "You guys really did it!")
```

_Note: If you send the receiver's mobile number more than once, the message will still be sent once._

### Response

All responses will come in hash with the status for each mobile number passed to the `send` method.

Here's an example:

```ruby
  {"091711292013" => true, "091711302013" => true, "123" => nil}
````

#### Statuses

Response | Which Means
--- | ---
(BOOL) true | Message Sent
(BOOL) false | Sending Failed
(NULL) nil | Invalid Mobile Number
